# Visualisations

This folder contains the visual outputs of the project *The Titanic, Retold in 20 Lifeboats*.

The infographics translate a six-month manual analysis of Titanic survivor data into long-form, editorial-style visual narratives. Rather than presenting isolated charts, the visuals reconstruct the disaster through the lens of its 20 lifeboats, treating each boat as a unit of decision-making, chance, and social structure.

## What the Visualisations Show

Across both infographics, several key findings emerge:

- **Survival was uneven and highly situational.**  
  Outcomes differed drastically from lifeboat to lifeboat. Some boats launched half-empty, others were overcrowded, and several were filled under chaotic or contradictory circumstances.

- **“Women and children first” was inconsistently applied.**  
  While slightly more women than men survived overall, the difference amounted to roughly one lifeboat’s capacity. In more than half of the lifeboats, men actually outnumbered women, particularly among crew members.

- **Crew members had higher survival rates than expected.**  
  In many cases, crew survived at higher rates than first-class passengers, likely due to proximity, experience, and knowledge of the ship and evacuation process.

- **Second-class passengers fared worst.**  
  Contrary to common assumptions, second-class passengers had the lowest survival rates overall, caught between physical barriers and delayed access to lifeboats.

- **Lifeboats reflect social microcosms.**  
  Patterns of class, nationality, age, and gender clustered within specific boats, allowing each lifeboat to be characterised by dominant traits (e.g. “The Crew Boat”, “The Crowded Boat”, “The Lebanese Boat”).

- **Rescue was prolonged and chaotic.**  
  Many survivors did not board boats directly from the ship. Transfers, returns, swimmers, collapsible boats, and rescue order all shaped who ultimately survived.

## Design Approach

The visualisations were designed as long-form infographics rather than dashboards. The goal was to prioritise:

- pattern recognition over single metrics  
- narrative clarity over technical density  
- human readability over abstraction  

Icons, colour-coding, and annotations are used deliberately to reflect uncertainty, chaos, and decision-making under pressure. The design draws inspiration from editorial and archival infographics rather than contemporary business analytics.
