# The Titanic, Retold in 20 Lifeboats

## Project Overview
I have been obsessed with the Titanic disaster for years, not just as a historical event, but as a human one.

Instead of approaching the Titanic dataset as a standard Kaggle challenge, this project grew out of curiosity: **Who exactly survived, on which lifeboat, and what do those lifeboats reveal when treated as individual units of analysis?**

This project reconstructs Titanic survival by focusing on the ship’s 20 lifeboats, analysing the passengers aboard each one and the patterns that emerge from those who survived.

It was also the first project that made me think:  
**“Oh. Yes. I think a data career might actually be for me.”**

## Research Motivation
Most Titanic analyses focus on predictive modelling or aggregate survival rates.

I wanted to do something different:
- slow down,
- clean and restructure the data manually,
- and let the research question evolve based on what the data revealed.

By working through the passenger records in detail, I became curious about **lifeboats as decision spaces**, shaped by class, gender, age, crew status, and command decisions made under extreme pressure.

## Research Question
**Who was saved on which lifeboat and what stories do the Titanic’s 20 lifeboats tell?**

---

## Data
- Cleaned and restructured Titanic passenger dataset (CSV)
- Lifeboat information reconstructed from passenger records and historical sources, investigative analysis of missing data.

---

## Methodology
- Manual data cleaning and restructuring in Excel
- Careful validation and cross-checking of passenger records
- Lifeboat-by-lifeboat aggregation of survivor data
- Exploratory statistics derived from surviving passengers
- Visual storytelling to communicate findings clearly

Rather than optimising for speed or automation, this project prioritised **accuracy, transparency, and interpretability**, drawing inspiration from archival and historical research workflows.

## Visualisation

The findings are presented through two long-form infographic PDFs designed in Canva.

Rather than focusing on isolated charts, the visualisations aim to **reconstruct the disaster as a sequence of human decisions**, combining statistics, symbols, and narrative labels. Each lifeboat is treated as its own story, while broader patterns such as class, gender, nationality, age, and crew status, emerge across the visuals.

The design intentionally mirrors editorial and archival infographics, prioritising:
- readability over technical density  
- pattern recognition over single metrics  
- storytelling over abstraction  

The goal was not only to analyse survival, but to make the data **legible, interpretable, and emotionally grounded**, allowing each lifeboat to function as a small historical record within the larger disaster.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, restructuring, aggregation)
- Manual exploratory analysis
- Canva (data visualisation & infographics)

---

## Project Scope & Timeline
- Duration: ~6 months  
- This was a self-directed exploratory project completed alongside fulltime work
- Iterative process: the research question evolved as patterns emerged

---

## Why This Project Matters To Me
This project was a personal turning point.

It showed me that data work doesn’t have to be abstract or detached, it can be narrative, investigative, and deeply human.  
Completing this analysis is what convinced me that pursuing a career in data and information science was not just possible, but meaningful to me.
